# company-calendar

## Intro
Build a Company Calendar App in PHP using Symfony. Each employer will have his own account to request days off, alert about sick days or send any kind of notification to their line manager. Line Manager will be able to accept days off, send messages to their team members. Employers will be organizing in Groups, and each Group will have his own settings about visibilities and policies.

I am building my custom made profiling system because at this time there is not yet a version available for Symfony 4 [FOSUserBundle]


## Using following PHP packages

<ul>
<li>annotations</li>
<li>debug</li>
<li>logger</li>
<li>twig</li>
<li>form</li>
<li>doctrine & maker - DB</l1>
<li>sessions</li>
<li>SonadaAdminBundle</li>
</ul>
